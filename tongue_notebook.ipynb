        "> Tongue cancer is a prevalent form of malignancy that affects the oral cavity, originating in the mouth and throat. The diagnosis, treatment, and management of this disease have been areas of active research and development. Current approaches to treatment typically involve surgical removal, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy, which have been the primary modalities used to address tongue cancer. The effectiveness of these treatments is closely associated with patients' survival outcomes. Traditional studies have relied on descriptive statistics to identify survival and risk factors, potentially overlooking complex and nonlinear relationships among clinical and demographic variables.\n",

        "> The comprehensive problem at hand is to develop a data-driven approach utilizing cutting-edge machine learning models and clinical data to accurately predict the survival of tongue cancer patients following treatment. By leveraging advanced techniques, we aim to address the limitations of traditional statistical approaches and enhance our ability to estimate patients' survival status.\n",
        ">\n",
        "> Specifically, our objectives include:\n",

        "> 1. Building a robust predictive model that incorporates a wide range of clinical and demographic variables to capture the complexity of tongue cancer and its impact on survival outcomes.\n",
        "> 2. Employing state-of-the-art machine learning models, such as Ridge regression, Lasso regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Support Vector Machines, to explore the nonlinear relationships and interactions among the variables.\n",
        "> 3. Applying rigorous evaluation methods, such as five-fold cross-validation, bootstrap analysis, and permutation feature importance, to estimate the performance of the predictive model and ensure its reliability.\n",
        "> 4. Comparing the performance of different machine learning models and identifying the most accurate and interpretable approach for survival prediction in tongue cancer.\n",
